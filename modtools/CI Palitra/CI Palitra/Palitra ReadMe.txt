Palitra Tool
---------------


Unfortunately in russian, but i included 2 screenshots which translate the buttons.

It is used for  2 things . One is to increase the amount of animations, (it duplicates frames) to give a feeling of longer animation, this could aswell be done with scripting and keeping the file smaller at the same time.

The other option is when you have extracted bmp's the color becomes blue and with this tool you can make it purple again.
