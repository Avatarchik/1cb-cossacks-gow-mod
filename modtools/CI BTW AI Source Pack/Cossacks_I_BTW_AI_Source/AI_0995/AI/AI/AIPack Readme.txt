AI_Pack Update v.0995

This version revises the water AI on mediterranean and water maps - best played with
1.5 to 2 hour peacetime. This will give AI enough time to build 18c frigates.
 
Ofcourse you can play in millions with no peacetime and AI will also make 18c frigates.

AI_Pack Update v0.992

This update revises the PT game further to make it more "intelligent" and even
better economic management. Improvements are mostly for land maps.
It also now includes Russia.

Best played with about 1 hour PT game as longer game will produce a very large army, 
so game is likely to crash. 

AI will continue to expand the base in very long PT games producing a huge amount
of 17c barracks. This is applied to all settings on land maps, even in millions
games.

This is the beta version of AI Pack for Cossacks Art of War.

There are several issues with AoW AI and this pack attempts to fix some of them:

1. As grenadiers behaves, well oddly, this tweaked AI will not produce grenadiers.
It makes archers (merc) and 18c musketeers instead.
2. Better economic management, so it will not starve itself and also makes larger
army in longer PT games.
3. On watermaps, it will also produce 18c units and calvary.
***I still cannot tweak it to produce the new ships as it has to do with resource
limitation. May be I'll look at this issue with the next version, perhaps on millions
resources.

The nations included in this packs are all of the European nations except Ukraine
and Russia. (I will do the rest if I have time, in the next version)

IMPORTANT: before installation, please go to your Cossacks The Art of War directory
and rename the AI folder to AI_Backup or something like that. This pack is for single
player only. Attempt to play this online while the other player(s) does not possess
the same pack will result in synchro error. When you wish to play online, you have to
manually rename the AI folder to AI_Mod and the AI_Backup back to AI, and vice versa.

To install, double click on the executable and please check the destination directory
to make sure that it is correct.

Enjoy!.
