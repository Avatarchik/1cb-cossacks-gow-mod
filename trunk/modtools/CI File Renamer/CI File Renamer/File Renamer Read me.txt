File Renamer version 1.00
-------------------------


What this tool does:

It allows you to rename a bunch of file's for usage with GSC Utility. Because GSC Utility only allows single file's to be dropped in the tool, you need to name your files to : FOLDER+FILE format so they appear in subfolders when creating .gsc .gs1 file's

How to use:

Drag and drop all file's to be renamed in the tool and add the prefix /file header at the bottom.
