
---------------------------
BMP To Tga converter v1.0

---------------------------

What this tool does:

This program binds extracted .bmp files from .gp files with their alpha channels to one single .tga file with build in alpha channels so they are compatible with Gigapacker for .g16 & .g17 format.

Usage:

Set the "directory" box to the path of a folder containing xxxxx.bmp and axxxxx.bmp files (try not to leave other BMPs in there, just in case). 

Set the "output directory" box to the path of your desired output folder. The rest of the options are set up already for you.
